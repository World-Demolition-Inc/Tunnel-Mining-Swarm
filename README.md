Master.lua: Master turtle, sets up the mining operation.

Server.lua: Computer, manages general data regarding the active mine.

Worker.lua: Worker turtle, gets data from the server and starts it's mining routine.


Master usage: Turtle with modem and pickaxe, installed script can have any name within the system.

Server usage: Installed on a computer with a modem, should be called startup.lua so the system will constantly stay within the server script. Not required though.

Worker usage: Installed onto a disk, MUST be labeled as startup.lua.

Server and Master will ask questions and guide you through the process. Make sure to setup the server and make a disk prior to trying to run the master system.

I'll probably make a video on the operation of these systems eventually, but most info can be found in the header of the files.
